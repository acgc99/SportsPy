# To do

## Backend
- DatabaseManagerRunningPlotter might become deprecated? Or just many change are needed?

## User Interface
- Add exit button next to the info label in every page (and respective warnings)
- Plotting: add options to choose what to plot in the left and right y-axis (vel, dens, dist, kcal, time)

## Profiles
- Use a dev profile to store testing data

## General
- Code revision
- When introduccing data allow missing values (how to deal with missing values?)
- If you introduce some data and go back, and then return, the previous data is still there?

# Others
- How to avoid imports of the same thing: my package uses numpy for example and the main code too
